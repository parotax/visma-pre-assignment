# Visma pre-assignment

## Description

### How I understood problem

How I understood the assignment was to create a class that takes a URI as input, verifies its validity, and returns the path and parameters of the URI. Additionally, I was tasked with creating a client for the class. The class will be used in an identity management application.

### Challenges

One of the challenges I faced during this assignment was breaking the class into smaller, more manageable functions. I initially had difficulty deciding how many and how small functions to create, but eventually decided that as long as the code worked efficiently and looked clean, it was sufficient.

### Further improvement

My implementation could be improved by:

- Breaking down the validation logic into smaller functions.
- Adding type hints to functions.
- Adding test cases.
- More meaningful commenting.
- Better error handling.
